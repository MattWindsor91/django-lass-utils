York website system.

Licence
=======

In short: 2-clause BSD or GPL version 2, take your pick.

``django-lass-utils``, as a spin-off from the *LASS* project, is
licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.  However, as
it was comprised entirely of code solely written by URY and/or code
not under licence, the original author decided to dual-license under
GPLv2 and the FreeBSD 2-clause license.

Usage
=====

Documentation is coming soon (there are docstrings in the actual code,
but nothing much else).
